# PowerTray

PowerTray is a simple replacement for the POwer icon in the Windows 10 systray.

It's goal is to simplify switching between Power Plans without having to find the Power Control Panel while keeping the original Power systray features.

The installer also enables the hidden 'Ultimate Performance' Power Plan in Windows 10.
